RefreshEnv.cmd is taken from Chocolatey. (https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/develop/src/chocolatey.resources/redirects/RefreshEnv.cmd)

Todo:
C#/WinForms rewrite for Windows?
Linux version

Usage:
Double click the install batch file, it will install Scoop and FFMPEG, then add the batch files to the Send to... menu, and restart Explorer.
(If you would prefer Chocolatey or your own build of FFMPEG, have one of those in PATH)

For this version, all you gotta do is just download the source zip. (Code -> Download ZIP)
